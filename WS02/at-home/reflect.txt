- Learning Outcome:

On this workshop, I learned how different concepts, that when applied, can have
similar results with with vastly different response times and approaches.

I learned about the difference in Copying a resource and Moving it in C++, where:

- Copying a resource (through copying constructors or operators) creates a copy
of said resource in memory, with the result being that twice the amount of memory
is used for both objects (the original and the copy) and the response time is
relatively slow.

- Moving a resource (through move constructors or operators) changes the address
reference of a resource, leaving the data intact. The result is that only 1 instance
of said resource exists in memory and the response time is vastly superior to copying.
Finally, the original object is emptied from memory, leaving only the resulting
object with the old data.

The difference in response time between Copying and Moving is due to the fact that
Copying assigns extra resources in memory for the new copy and process every data
in the old object to copy it to the new object. Moving consists of changing only
the alias of the memory location, changing from the old object pointer to the new
object pointer.
